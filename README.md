OpenSync 


OpenSync is a Open Source CalDAV/CardDAV (Contacts and Calendars) Sync for Android. it has been tested with Nextcloud Server. its integrates natively in Android calendar/contact apps. its a fork from opensource project DavDroid https://davdroid.bitfire.at/source/.

========

Its licensed under the [GPLv3 License](LICENSE). same as davdroid.

Its mine attempt to make a Android App for CalDAV/CardDAV for NextCloud based on OpenSource.
ITs still Beta from my side as its some basic changes to orginal code of DavDroid.
Would try to find time to add more into this app.
